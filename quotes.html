  <blockquote>All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>It's kind of fun to do the impossible.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>If you can dream it, you can do it.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>The more you like yourself, the less you are like anyone else, which makes you unique.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>You can design and create, and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality.</blockquote>
